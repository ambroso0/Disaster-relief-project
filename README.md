In early 2010 Haiti was hit by a magnitude 7.0 earthquake. This catastrophe leveled many buildings, and resulted in numerous lives lost. In the wake of the earthquake, more than 50% of the population at the time, were displaced, with 1.5 million of them living in tent camps. This wide-spread displacement of people across the island, made relief efforts more difficult. 
In this scenario, we are working towards developing a predictive model which will help locating displaced people using RGB data extracted from aerial imagery of the country. It was known that displaced people were using blue tarp to create tent to shelter them. This distinguishable blue color was used to facilitate the identification of displaced people through aerial images.  For this purpose, we have a data set of RGB values and categorical variables denoting the structure types present in the images.  This dataset will be used to develop a model that has a high detection rate regarding true positives in order to maximize its capability to save lives in a precise manner. We will consider the accuracy and the False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) as metrics to determine the performance of the model selected. In particular the FPR has the potential to draw false conclusion and to jeopardize the rescue efforts in a context where time is the essence in terms of saving lives.
